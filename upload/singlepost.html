						<p>In 1999, the American Journal of Epidemiology published the findings of a five-year study conducted in the mid to late eighties that revealed that drinking a bottle a beer a day might reduce the risk of kidney stones by 40%.
Beer strengthens bones. It is rich in Silica which is, in fact, the catalyst for collagen formation and the carrier of calcium into bone.
In In January 2015, the Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry published a study conducted by a team of researchers at Lanzhou University in China that claims that xanthohumol, a type of flavonoid found in hops, could help protect the brain against the onset of diseases such as Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and dementia and may even prevent cancer.
The antioxidants in beer have anti-aging properties. Beer adds a natural glow to your face and moisturizes the skin. Even ancient Egyptians took frequent beer baths.
There is an old saying that pouring a beer over your head a day leaves your hair voluminous, smooth and shiny. This has something to do with the naturally present proteins and Vitamin B. In fact an American company has launched a new range of beer-based shampoos. Bröö offers three sets of shampoos and conditioners which use beer as their main ingredient: Pale Ale (for volume), IPA (for smoothness) and Porter (for Hydration).
Drinking beer may help reduce the risk of arthritis. In a recent study in Arthritis & Rheumatism, women who drank three to five beers per week had a 31% lower risk for rheumatoid arthritis, (a disease that primarily affects women) compared to women who abstained from drinking.
There is no such thing as a Beer Belly! Beer is in reality, low in calories, low in carbohydrates and has no fat or cholesterol.
